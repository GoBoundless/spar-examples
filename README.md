# Spar Examples
Welcome to Spar Examples! You will find several sample applications riding on top of [Spar](http://boundlesslearning.github.com/spar). Straight to the moon!

## Spine TODO
Spar favors CoffeeScript, so here is the TODO MVC app using Spine.js, built on top of Spar. We've also included Haml-Coffee for fat templating feast.

## My App
An app just the way we like it, with jQuery, Backbone, and Twitter Bootstrap for kickstart the pretty. Spar is totally behind [Twitter Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) and can compile components you install with it. Nifty.
